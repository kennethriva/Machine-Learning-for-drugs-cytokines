You can use RcpiDescCalc.R to calculate drug descriptors for SMILES formulas.
You need:
- place the list of SMILES into smi/chembl_can-1.txt (one SMILES each row, no other column! keep the empty line at the end of the file)
- run the script to produce one file with descriptors for each SMILES in Rcpi folder
- get all these results in only one file running getRcpiResults.py (python script)

Have fun!
